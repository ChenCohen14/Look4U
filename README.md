# Look4U
This project describes the development of an application that simulates a prototype system for matching people with a common purpose. The goal of the project is to consolidate most of the existing platforms such as Easy, Facebook, oKcupid and the like into one,dynamic platform whose content is built by users for their needs.
The system is divided into 3 parts:
1.A dedicated application (Look4U) of the system that finds a match between users in a particular area.
2.A server side that computes, performs API reads, and addresses the database.
3.The database that contains all the content of the app.
During this project, an application will be developed that uses the components and services of an Android operating system environment on a mobile device.
This system will allow users to fill in filtering criteria (age range and gender) of the users with whom they wish to find a match,
compile and publish multiple-choice test in existing categories and / or add their own categories.
Users will also be able to apply to the authors of the questionnaire by entering age and gender range filtering criteria and answering the questionnaires.
The system will match the questionnaire advertisers with the users who want to answer the questionnaires and will calculate matching rates.
The results of the matches found and calculated by the system will be presented to the questionnaire advertisers in a sorted list with the option
of opening a chat between the parties.
